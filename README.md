# 1 Summary and Motivation
Skin cancer is the fourth greatest cause of non-fatal disease burden in the world. This burden affects both high- and low-income countries, indicating that skin cancer prevention should be prioritized. In this study, an intelligent diagnosis strategy for multi-class skin cancer categorization is provided. Nowadays almost everyone suffer from skin cancer.Various forms of skin cancer affect millions of individuals throughout the world. In recent years, computer-assisted skin examinations and characterization of skin cancer have increased. Examinations carried out include detecting and modeling human skin cancer. However, it is difficult to synthesize and analyze human skin because of the complexity of wrinkles, color differences, presence of hair, and other mitigation features, plus variations in dermatological diseases that occur due to geographical factors such as temperature, humidity and other environmental factors. On the other hand, detecting skin cancer is very time consuming and expensive at the same time. This research will help human to detect skin cancer in early stage. This research has been presented as an intelligent expert to perform the multi-class classification of skin cancer using deep learning algorithms. Another thing is, in the field of medical science 2 this research plays an important role. It is observed that better results and precision can be achieved when the algorithm is trained with more number of images.

The research aims at enriching the knowledge and understanding of skin cancer. 
* The goal of this study is to develop with deep learning classifier for detecting skin cancer.
* If we can detect these cancers at an early stage then we can reduce the death rate and we can easily cure this cancer. 
* This system can help to improve the accurate analysis of skin cancers which helps the dermatologists to accelerate the diagnostic time and improve the better treatment for the patients.
* Diagnosing these cancers will save us both time and money
# 2 Development process and Data
# 2.1 Data Property
I have considered skin ailment of the various regions of the world as trial images. My dataset consists of 4538 samples of images and there are 7 classes. Here I have created a class of Noncancer by myself
# 2.2 Data Collection 
The term "dataset" refers to a collection of data. Our research study focuses on collecting an original dataset and how it will perform if we try to predict a skin cancer with different deep learning techniques. We used the original dataset from: 
* Kaggle 
* Dermnet nz. 
* Ham10000 
* Google source
# 2.3 Data Preprocessing
* Data Augmentation 
*  Resize 
* Threshold segmentation
# Tools to Use
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Mathplotlib
* Numpy
